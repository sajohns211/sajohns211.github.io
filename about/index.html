			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I received degrees in Economics and Environmental Science from Northwestern University in 2017. In my undergraduate career I developed an interest in energy economics, specifically in energy markets and energy policy, through energy economic research with Professor Mar Reguant, an internship at a Chicago based solar company, and campus involvement with energy consumption and efficiency. In my senior year, I received the Frederick S. Deibler Award for Distinguished Honors Thesis for my thesis on the effect of wind energy on wholesale electricity prices in Texas. At Stanford GSB, I have taken quantitative coursework and worked on economics research projects with Professors Kathryn Shaw, Aruna Ranganathan, Rebecca Diamond, Tim McQuade, and Shai Bernstein.  </p>
