			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I received degrees in Economics and Environmental Science from Northwestern University in 2017. In my undergraduate career I developed an interest in energy economics, specifically on energy markets and energy policy, through enery economic research with Professor Mar Reguant, work at a Chicago based solar company, and campus involvement with energy consumption and efficiency. In my senior year, I received the Frederick S. Deibler Award for Distinguished Honors Thesis for my work on the effect of wind energy on wholesale electricity prices in Texas. At Stanford GSB, I have taken quantitative coursework and worked on four economics research projects.  </p>
